# Text Intent Classification

Intent Classification is an important component of chatbot platform. Let's say you tell a robot to *‘please schedule a meeting at 10 am’*. Then the robot need to be able to recognize what is the intention of the sentence. Is it about asking for creating a meeting schedule? Is it about checking the schedule? Or is it about canceling a meeting schedule?

This repository contains a text classifier with SVM in IPython Notebook format. A very small sample dataset of meeting scheduler is provided, which is created and labeled by myself.
